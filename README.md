# Super SameBoy

Super SameBoy is a Qt-based interface of SameBoy, a free, highly accurate Game
Boy and Game Boy Color emulator.

You will need Qt5 (Qt6 does not have QController yet). SameBoy also requires an
installation of RGBDS to build the boot ROMs. This project also uses Python (for
building only - it doesn't use it at runtime). Lastly, you will need a copy of
SameBoy's source code. One is tracked via `git submodule`, but you may choose to
use a different version.

SameBoy can be found at https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy
