For reporting issues, GitHub is the best way to do this as issues are easily
tracked. You can do this at https://github.com/SnowyMouse/super-sameboy/issues

Here are a few guidelines for doing this:

* English is recommended for the smoothest experience. While Google Translate
  exists, its accuracy is pretty shaky.

* Screenshots, videos, etc. are very helpful.

* Ensure you are on the latest version.

Please note that Super SameBoy is *not* a fork of SameBoy. Please do not report
SameBoy issues here.

To check if an issue is SameBoy-related, it is recommended to compile and test
SameBoy, first, such as the SDL or Cocoa versions. You can easily do this by
cloning the SameBoy repository at https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy and building
with the makefile. If you can reproduce your issue on SameBoy, report it on the
SameBoy issues list instead at https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy/issues
