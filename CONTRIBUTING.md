# Bug reports

For reporting bugs, GitHub is the best way to do this as issues are easily
tracked. You can do this at https://github.com/SnowyMouse/superdux/issues

Here are a few guidelines for doing this:

* English is recommended for the smoothest experience. While Google Translate
  exists, its accuracy is pretty shaky.

* Screenshots, videos, etc. are very helpful.

* Ensure you are on the latest version.

Please note that SuperDUX is *not* a fork of SameBoy. Please do not report
SameBoy issues here.

To check if an issue is SameBoy-related, it is recommended to compile and test
SameBoy, first, such as the SDL or Cocoa versions. You can easily do this by
cloning the SameBoy repository at https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy and building
with the makefile. If you can reproduce your issue on SameBoy, report it on the
SameBoy issues list instead at https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy/issues

# Requests

Like with reporting bugs, you can use the issue tracker on GitHub to request
features for the frontend at https://github.com/SnowyMouse/superdux/issues
Again, I ask that you make your request in English. Google Translate's accuracy
is not very good.

Please note that, depending on the feature you want, it may be better suited to
be added to SameBoy's core functionality rather than the frontend. If so, you
should request it at https://github.com/LIJI32/SameBoy/issues instead. If the
feature exists in SameBoy's core, you can then request it to be used in
SuperDUX.
